<h1> COMPUTER-SCIENCE Introduction </h1> 
<br/> 
<br/> 
<br/> 

<h2> What is Computer-Science?</h2> 
<br/> 
<br/> 

<p> Computer-Science encompasses everything regarding computers theoretical and practical. Though the semantics don’t matter that much.</p>
<br/> 
<br/> 

<h3> Why should you care ? </h3> 
 <br/> 

 <p>These days Computer-Science has become more and more popular and for good reasons.
Everyone has a miniature computer, that is performant enough to take care of everyday need
like this little guy: </p>
 
  <img class="smartphone" src="img/teg" alt="pic of an android phone or smth idk">
 
 
<p> Also there are literally robots that can hold conversation with you and more.
It is kind of crazy to think, that in some cases the idea of these things did not even exist 20 years back.
And even now we are revolutionizing some piece of tech everyday all around the world. 
Though that’s not all, because almost everything nowadays depends on computation or rather computers. A lot of our infrastructure nowadays is really dependant on secure servers, secure data and functioning computers.
The best example are banks.
But personally I do not think of it as just some kind of job that you do 9-5 and then it’s over.
It’s more like a fun hobby that also pays you. 
This kind of field is perfect for everyone, that wants intellectual stimulation and or want to learn more and more everyday. 
With the Internet and more and more online-ressources its easier than ever to learn something, however their quality is not often reassuring, that is why, we aim to introduce you to areas and give you the most useful learning ressources. 
Just as a side-note this website was made by one person: “me” and I do not have web development-degree or something like that. Almost everything I know about Computer-Science, came from my love for computers and my unendless interest in everything surrounding it. 
</p> 
<br/> 
<br/> 
<br/> 

<h2> About this website</h2>

<br/> 
<br/> 

<p> Because Computer-Science becomes more and more important, I hope to awake interest in certain topics.
On this website we are aiming to introduce you to certain elements of computer-science, like Computer-Hardware, Simple Programming in C# and other very interesting areas in Computer-Science. 
And where we can we will also give you some fun little projects to do.
We have a little navigation-bar on the left side, that allows you to navigate to other sites on here. 
Provided on every single one of these areas are links to learning resources or links to where we got these infos. 
If you feel you do not understand some words or phrases, then do not worry, just refer to our CP-ABC (Computerscience ABC). 
In there we have some commonly known phrases, that I feel you should atleast know in the field.

Have fun!
